### Foundry is a blazing fast, portable and modular toolkit for Ethereum application development written in Rust.

Foundry consists of:

- [**Forge**](#forge): Ethereum testing framework (like Hardhat and Ape).
- [**Cast**](#cast): Swiss army knife for interacting with EVM smart contracts, sending transactions and getting chain data.
- [**Anvil**](#anvil): Local Ethereum node, akin to Hardhat Network, Tenderly.
- [**Chisel**](#chisel): Fast, utilitarian, and verbose solidity REPL.

**Need help getting started with Foundry? Read the [ðŸ“– Foundry Book][foundry-book]!**

![Demo](.github/demo.gif)

## Installation

See the [installation guide](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation) in the book.

If you're experiencing any issues while installing, check out [Getting Help](#getting-help) and the [FAQ](https://book.getfoundry.sh/faq).

## Forge

### Features

- **Fast & flexible compilation pipeline**
  - Automatic Solidity compiler version detection & installation
  - **Incremental compilation & caching**: Only changed files are re-compiled
  - Parallel compilation
  - Non-standard directory structures support (e.g. [Hardhat repos](https://twitter.com/gakonst/status/1461289225337421829))
- **Tests are written in Solidity**
- **Fast fuzz testing** with shrinking of inputs & printing of counter-examples
- **Fast remote RPC forking mode**, leveraging Rust's async infrastructure like Tokio
- **Flexible debug logging** using [ForgeStd](https://github.com/foundry-rs/forge-std)'s `console.sol`
- **Portable & easy to install** without requiring Nix or any other package manager
- **Fast CI** with the [Foundry GitHub action][foundry-gha].

### How Fast?

Forge is quite fast at both compiling (leveraging `solc` with [foundry-compilers]) and testing.

See the benchmarks below. More benchmarks can be found in the [v0.2.0 announcement post][benchmark-post] and in the [Convex Shutdown Simulation][convex] repository.

### Testing Benchmarks

| Project                                                     | [Forge 1.0][foundry-1.0] | [Forge 0.2][foundry-0.2] | DappTools | Speedup |
| ----------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------ | --------- | ------- |
| [vectorized/solady][solady]                                 | 0.9s                     | 2.3s                     | -         | 2.6x    |
| [morpho-org/morpho-blue][morpho-blue] (invariant)           | 0.7s                     | 1m43s                    | -         | 147.1x  |
| [morpho-org/morpho-blue-oracles][morpho-blue] (integration) | 45.9s                    | 47.9s                    | -         | 1.04x   |
| [transmissions11/solmate][solmate]                          | 2.7s                     | 2.8s                     | 6m34s     | 140.0x  |
| [reflexer-labs/geb][geb]                                    | 0.2s                     | 0.4s                     | 23s       | 57.5x   |

_Notes_:

- _In the above benchmarks, compilation was always skipped_
- _Invariant tests were ran once at 256 depth_

### Compilation Benchmark

Compilation benchmark of [vectorized/solady][solady]:

| Type        | Foundry 1.0 | Hardhat 2.22.17 | Speedup |
| ----------- | ----------- | --------------- | ------- |
| Cold        | 0.58s       | 1.65s           | 2.8x    |
| Light Cache | 0.38s       | 1.24s           | 3.3x    |
| Deep Cache  | 0.57s       | 1.27s           | 2.2x    |
| Full Cache  | 0.17s       | 0.35s           | 2.1x    |

Takeaway: Forge compilation is consistently faster than Hardhat by a factor of **2.1-3.3x**, depending on the amount of caching involved.

More documentation can be found in the [forge crate](./crates/forge/README.md).

## Cast

Cast is a swiss army knife for interacting with Ethereum applications from the command line.

More documentation can be found in the [cast crate](./crates/cast/README.md).

## Anvil

More documentation can be found in the [anvil crate](./crates/anvil/README.md).

## Chisel

More documentation can be found in the [chisel crate](./crates/chisel/README.md).

## Configuration

Foundry is designed to be very configurable. You can configure Foundry using a file called [`foundry.toml`](./crates/config) in the root of your project, or any other parent directory. See [config package](./crates/config/README.md#all-options) for all available options.

Configuration can be arbitrarily namespaced by profiles. The default profile is named `default` (see ["Default Profile"](./crates/config/README.md#default-profile)).

You can select another profile using the `FOUNDRY_PROFILE` environment variable. You can also override parts of your configuration using `FOUNDRY_` prefixed environment variables, like `FOUNDRY_SRC`.

`forge init` creates a basic, extendable `foundry.toml` file.

To see your current configuration, run `forge config`. To see only basic options (as set with `forge init`), run `forge config --basic`. This can be used to create a new `foundry.toml` file with `forge config --basic > foundry.toml`.

By default `forge config` shows the currently selected foundry profile and its values. It also accepts the same arguments as `forge build`.

### Additional Configuration

You can find additional setup and configurations guides in the [Foundry Book][foundry-book]:

- [Setting up VSCode][vscode-setup]
- [Shell autocompletions][shell-setup]
